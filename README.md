# Competitive Programming Algorithms and Data Structures

To compile any test, simply run the following code on terminal:

`g++ -O2 -o file file.cpp`

Notice the test files include ".cpp" files. This is considered bad practice, but it doesn't matter for our purposes (in competitive programming you can only upload a single file as answer, so it doesn't make sense to split our data structures in ".h" and ".cpp" files).
